            <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
            <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web
              </li>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>Elements included within the <head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: 
            <ul>
              <li>Inline CSS: style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
              <li>Internal CSS style sheet embeds an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a (style) element in the (head) element</li>
              <li>The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
              <li>External CSS style sheet: allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file</li>
              <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a <link> element placed in the HTML's (head)</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Class Attributes: Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time</li>
          <lli>GitHub allows multiple developers to work on a single project at the same time, reduces the risk of duplicative or conflicting work, and can help decrease production time.</lli>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A string is a sequence of text. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>An array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li> Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse and executes when you call the function name in your code. </li>
